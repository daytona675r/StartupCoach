- Internet connection

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daytona675r/StartupCoach.git
cd StartupCoach
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables for real mode:
```bash
# Create a .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Credential-free demo mode

For a recruiter-friendly local preview, run the deterministic replay UI:

```bash
DEMO_MODE=1 streamlit run app.py
```

Demo mode uses labelled sample outputs for mentor chat, the Business Model
Canvas, pitch-deck structure and analytics. It performs no OpenAI call and
reports example token/cost values. Real mode remains local/private and requires
`OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application is built using a modular architecture:

- **app.py**: Main application entry point
- **chat_manager.py**: Handles chat functionality and message history
- **tools_manager.py**: Manages business tools and their execution
- **dashboard.py**: Handles analytics and visualization
- **token_tracker.py**: Tracks and manages token usage
- **translations.py**: Manages multi-language support
- **help_guide.py**: Provides user guidance and documentation

## 🔧 Configuration

The application can be configured through environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `MODEL_NAME`: The OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4)
- `TEMPERATURE`: Model temperature setting (default: 0.7)

## 🌐 Multi-language Support
